# Resume-Website
IST 3700

Personal Development Project

Objectives:

Use a semantic approach to design a personal resume website. Put into practice using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

Process:

You will first define the content of the website. Your first step is to brainstorm what information you would like to present. This may include but not limited to education, work history, awards, skills list, etc. Create an outline of the content followed by a wireframe. Continue to allow the content to dictate the types of HTML elements to be used.

Requirements and grading criteria:

Grading will be based on creativity as well as the following:

• Your site should use Git for version control.

• Semantic code that describes the content.

• Your website needs to have a defined structure with separate directories for
CSS, JS, and image files.

• All CSS and JS should be contained in their own files with no inline CSS.

• Your website should contain at least one contact form. May be traditional or
ajax.

• Your website should use at least one javaScript library. jQuery etc.
Deliverables

The final deliverable should be a zipped file containing a wireframe and your website files. This should be emailed to tysonharper@weber.edu
